                        <h3>Animation Festival Reflection</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>While at the Ottawa International Animation Festival we saw many animations and received talks from multiple universities and colleges about their animation programs. These talks were informative and gave us an insight into what their programs and campus had to offer to support our learning.</p>
                        <p>I think that Vancouver Film School had a very interesting layout since they only offer one-year very intensive programs. I  personally don't know if I would do well in this program due to how it is structured. Furthermore, it is also very far away, and I don't want to leave Ontario (even though British Columbia is very beautiful).</p>
                        <p>Many people in the community around me have given colleges, namely Algonquin, a stigma. However, after learning about the school, its alumni, its awards, etc. I've come to realise that it isn't a terrible program. However, I do find it interesting that their only partnership to turn the diploma into a bachelor's degree is through a university in Scotland. I also find it interesting that they haven't really changed their demo reel for many years.</p>
                        <p>Something else I noted: most of the presenters weren't very enthusiastic, or at least it didn't seem that way. I found it easy to doze off or start daydreaming. The only presenter that I found entertaining was from the Vancouver Film School.</p>
                        <p>If I were to go into animation, I would probably be a storyboard artist. I enjoy designing stories from a script and letting my imagination let loose. Furthermore,  since I dislike redrawing similar frames over and over again, I don't have to redraw the same frames over and over again.</p>
