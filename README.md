# Alex's Portfolio Website

Portfolio Website created by Alex Wang. Contains projects from Feb 2022 - Jan 2024.

📖 <u>**Context**</u>
> The original design for this portfolio website was created in a Google site for a high school class (Communications Technology (TGJ4M)). In this course, we learned to produce digital media through apps like Adobe Photoshop, Lighroom, Premier, and Illustrator. We also learned how to take photos and shoot movies using real studio equipment. 
> 
> For the summative project, we created a portfolio website containing all the projects we worked on over the course of the semester. To build my grade 12 portfolio, I expanded off my grade 11 portfolio and created a new grade 12 section. 
> 
> Since then, I have updated the information in this website, summarised the digital media sections, and added new sections regarding my musical experiences and coding experiences.

📚 <u>**Purpose**</u>
> The purpose of building this website was to learn how to use HTML and CSS. This is the first website I have ever built using code. After following a few tutorials explaining the basic features of HTML and CSS, I jumped straight into building this website. I chose to recreate my high school portfolio because I had already designed all the pages, which would allow me to focus on the coding aspect of this project.
